ABOUT POLYPAY

Polypay is a payment system that enables users send Cryptocurrency to anybody in the world.
The smart contract is deployed on Polygon zkEVM which is a “testnet" and not  “mainnet" .

It uses the Vite framework,
This is aimed at speeding up development with the HMR (Hot Module reload). It doesn't need to bundle all the scripts before returning the requested content.

The front-end  enables the selection of multiple wallet option for the transaction, such as metamask, coinbase, trust wallet, rainbow or through a wallet-connect.

There is a section that has a description of your wallet address, similar to what we have in a debit.
