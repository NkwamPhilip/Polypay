## ABOUT POLYPAY

- Polypay is a payment system that enables users send Cryptocurrency to anybody in the world.
The smart contract is deployed on Polygon zkEVM which is a “testnet" and not  “mainnet" . 

- Polygon is a Layer 2 blockchain that aims to help Ethereum with its scalability. By acting as a Layer 2 protocol, Polygon doesn't aim to duplicate Ethereum's functionality. Instead, it helps improve transaction speeds and lower costs for developers.

- Polypay uses the Vite framework,
this is aimed at speeding up development with the HMR (Hot Module reload). It doesn't need to bundle all the scripts before returning the requested content.

- The front-end  makes provisions for multiple wallet options for the transaction such as metamask, coinbase, trust wallet, rainbow or through a wallet-connect.

- It features  a section that has a description of your wallet address, similar to that of  a debit card.
